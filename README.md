# SFMaven
SFMaven (Single File Maven) is an attempt to get a working maven repository with a single php file. 

## Webserver Compatibility
### Apache: Full ✅
Rename the example htaccess file and put `sfmaven.php` in your document root.
### Nginix: Maybe ⚠
I don't personally use nginix and would appreciate if someone could contribute an example config.

## Usage
### Getting Started
Download the latest release and extract `sfmaven.php`. Make sure to follow the instructions outlined in the webserver compatibilty section above.
### Configuration
Open `sfmaven.php` and edit the variables at the top of the file. Each variable is documented (with its default value) with a comment above its definition.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! This is my first time using php and advice is greatly appreciated.
